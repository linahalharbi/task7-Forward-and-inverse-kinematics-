Description 

Materials :- 

Arduino Uno . 
2 Servo motors . 

Connection:- 

 the  Servo motor :- 

Yellow wire to D9 pin   
Brown wire to GND pin 
Red wire to 5v pin 

Forward kinematic
 
How it works ?  
o compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters. 

The code :- 

1- declaring the L1,L1,Q1,Q2,q1q2 . AS WELL AS Substitute values of L1,L2,Q
2- including servo library .
3-void setup which to  put in the code that you want to run one time  , basically include the pinMode of servo motor . 
4- void loop to  put in the code that you want to run continuously . 
In it I put the functions and equations that tells the motor to turn by given angles to find the position (x,y) . 

Inverse kinematics 
How it works ? 
The reverse process that computes the angles parameters that achieve a specified / certain position of the end-effector is known .

4- void loop to  put in the code that you want to run continuously . In it I put the equations to find the angles to let the servo motor turn into by given a certain position (2,4) .
